## A Generic Project Template for Open Science Related Work

Welcome! This repository provides an infrastructure for open science oriented empirical projects. It is organized around a toy project taht explores discretionary accrual on U.S. data. Thus, the code base should give you a feel on how it is supposed to be used. Currently, this is still very much in its infancy. You can help by contributing to it via pull requests.


### How should I use it?

The basic idea is to clone the repository whenever you start a new project. Then delete everything that you don't like and/or need. Over time, as you develop your own preferences, you can fork this repository and adjust it so that it becomes your own template targeted to your preferences.


### Is this based on a specific choice of Software?

Currently, all in here is R based but in principle the template should be software agnostic. One way to improve this repo is to provide Python or Stata code that mimics the example R code. 


### Why do you do abc in a certain way? I like to do things differently!

Scientific workflows are a matter of preference and taste. What we present here is based on our experiences on what works well but this by no means implies that there are not other and better ways to do things. So, feel free to disagree and to build your own template. Or: Convince us by submitting a pull request!


### But there are other templates. Why yet another one?

Of course there are and they a great. The reason why we decided to whip up our own is that we wanted a template that also includes some of the default style elements that we use in our collaborative research center [TRR 266 "Accounting for Transparency"](https://accounting-for-transparency.de). And we wanted to have a template that is centered on workflows that are typical in the accounting and finance domain. Here you go.
